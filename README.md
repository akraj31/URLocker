# URLocker: Password Protection for websites

## The Issue
Many websites nowadays have some kind of signup and login mechanism. And most of the websites show “keep me logged in” option on the login page. If you are using your personal computer or laptop you almost always choose this option because this makes sense for the websites which you frequently visit and you don’t want to log in by entering username and password each time you visit.

Now in this situation what if you have to share your laptop with someone for any reason. The person can access all your logged in site without any problem, right. You can tell them to use a different browser, but that is subjective to the trust you have on that person that in your absence he/she will not peek into your logged in account.


## Benefit of URLocker
- You can password protect your individual sites.
- Whenever someone will try to open any website which you password protected using
this extension, they will be asked for the password.
- This is analogous to having app­lock for your apps on your android or ios mobile
phones.
- If they don’t know the password they can’t access your logged site.
- What if they want to use the same website with their own login? Then they should use
Incognito mode.

## What if someone disables or uninstall the extension?
- This limitation can be taken care of by adding the “chrome://extension” to the password protected URLs.
